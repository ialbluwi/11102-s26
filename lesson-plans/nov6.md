# **15.** Lists (Introduction)
<span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: normal; color: gray;">For November 6, 2025</span>

## Overview

By this point, understanding lists should not be difficult to students, as they can transfer much of what they learned about strings to lists. This lecture is the first of 5 lectures on lists. 

## Lecture Outline

Go through [Chapter 9](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/chap09.html) and cover everything until 9.8 inclusive. If you are done early, you can use the time to solve any exercise that involves iterating over a list.
