<span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: normal; color: gray;">For October 26, 2025</span>

## Lecture Goals

The goal of this lecture is to expose students to programs involving nested loops. This includes also exposing them to the idea of creating a function and calling it inside a loop.

## Lecture Outline

You can use the examples in the student [notes](/11102-s26/lessons/nested-loops). Be prepared with a few more examples, just in case you finish these examples early.
