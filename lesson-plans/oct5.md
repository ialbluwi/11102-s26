# **1.** Introduction to The Course
<span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: normal; color: gray;">For October 5, 2025</span>


## Overview
The goal of this lecture is just to engage the students, get them excited about the course, and give them a high level overview of what to expect. You can lead this lecture in whatever way you like, but I will share below one suggested outline.

The outline below uses the following resources:
- [Slides](/11102-s26/lessons/slides/Day1.pdf)
- [Heavy Box Game](/11102-s26/assets/demos/boxes.html)
- [Intelligent Paper](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XFpdOEGN5ltiIlHmvWoFIs30WTTrWGb9?usp=sharing)

If all sections end up using this outline, I will share the slides and the game link on the course website (after removing the slides that are specific to me).

## Outline

### 1. Introduction
Introduce yourself and what we'll be doing in this lecture.

### 2. Find The Heavy Box Game

{: .highlight-title}
> 💡 _This is the first of three activities in this lecture, whose goal is to get the students excited about what they will be learning in this course._

1. Start by explaining the problem (as described in the slides and the game link above).
2. Ask the students to think about how they would solve this problem (individually or in pairs) for 2-3 minutes.
3. Ask a few students to share their ideas. The goal is to show that _Solution 1_ (from the slides) is straightforward but takes a long time.
4. Discuss _Solution 2_ (from the slides) and demonstrate it using the game link above. Ask them about the number of times we will have to use the scale if the number of boxes becomes 20,000 instead of 10,000 (in each of solutions 1 and 2).
5. Give the strong message: A grand challenge in computer science is to find efficient solutions to problems. You will get a taste of this in this course!

### 3. Average Age

1. Start by describing the problem (as described in the slides above).
2. Ask the students to think about how they would solve this problem (individually or in pairs) for 2-3 minutes.
3. Ask a few students to share their ideas and highlight privacy issues with their solutions (e.g., the partial reveal of ages in _Solution 1_ from the slides).
4. Discuss _Solution 2_ (from the slides). To demonstrate it, you can give students in the first row a piece of paper and show how the idea works.
5. Give the strong message: A grand challenge in computer science is to find solutions that respect privacy. You will get a taste of this in this course!

### 4. The Intelligent Paper

{: .warning-title}
> IMPORTANT
>
> Skip this activity if you are running out of time! 

The goal of this activity is inspire students to think about what _intelligence_ means. It is more of a performative activity, where you challenge their intuition about what intelligence means.

1. Start by holding up [this sheet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XFpdOEGN5ltiIlHmvWoFIs30WTTrWGb9?usp=sharing) and claiming that you managed after a lot of research and hard work to make it an _intelligent paper_.
2. Ask students to raise their hand if they believe you.
3. Tell them that you will prove it by making the paper play crosses and noughts (tic-tac-toe) against the class.
4. Draw a 3x3 grid on the board and ask a student to help the paper. While the paper is intelligent and will do all the thinking, it is paralyzed. This does not mean it is not intelligent!
5. Ask the student to read from the paper where to put the first cross (the paper insists to play first!)
6. The paper will either win or draw regardless of how the class plays.
7. After playing once or twice, you can lead a very quick discussion on whether the paper is really intelligent (or is it the human who wrote the instructions on the paper who is intelligent? In the same sense, is ChatGPT intelligent or not?).
8. End with the strong message: A grand challenge in computer science is to find solutions that exhibit intelligence. You will get a taste of this in this course!

> These activities can be time sinks. Make sure to keep an eye on the clock and make decisions on the fly about whether to skip an activity or not based on how much time you have left.

### 5. Course Overview
Emphasize whatever you think is important. However, make sure students don't leave the lecture without knowing the following:
1. The rough breakdown of the course (7 weeks of Python followed by applications: one per week).
2. That there will be weekly practice exercises and self-assessment quizzes.
3. The course website link.
4. That they need to accept the invitation sent to their email from EdStem.
5. That they need to read the course website and do the **policy quiz** and **pre-course survey** before the next lecture.

## Final Notes
- This is your chance to set the tone for the rest of the course. Make sure to be enthusiastic and excited about the course. If you are excited, your students will be too!
- My slides, lecture notes, and the website can (and will) contain typos and issues. Please report anything you spot so that I can fix it!
