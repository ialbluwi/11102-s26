## Overview

The main goals of this lecture are:
1. Practicing loops.
2. Practicing problem decomposition using functions.
3. Introducing Turtle Graphics (they will need it for the project).
4. Having fun!

## Lecture Outline

Follow the outline in the [notes](/11102-f25/lessons/turtle). 

Note that the outline mentions installing Turtle Graphics. Don't do that in the lecture. Just point out that it is already installed in Ed, but it needs installation for use in VSCode.
