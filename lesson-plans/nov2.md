# **13.** Strings (Basics)
<span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: normal; color: gray;">For November 2, 2025</span>

## Overview

This lecture is ~25 minutes long only, because the last ~20 minutes are dedicated for the quiz.

This lecture will introduce strings. The following lecture will involve examples on iterating over strings and/or manipulating them.

## Lecture Topics

Cover everything in [P4E.6](https://do1.dr-chuck.com/pythonlearn/EN_us/pythonlearn.pdf#page=79) excluding 6.6 (iteration), 6.10 (parsing), and 6.11 (fstrings). This includes:
- What is a string?
- Indexing (positive and negative).
- Immutability (`my_string[0] = 'a'` is not allowed).
- Slicing (with jumps)
- Comparison (meaning of `==`, `<`, `>`)
- The `in` operator (without loops. E.g, `'him' in 'Ibrahim'` is `True` while `'ibra' in 'Ibrahim'` is `False` because the operator is case-sensitive).
- String Methods. Don't cover everything. Tell them that they should look at the book to see what methods are available. Briefly mention/demo methods like: `upper`, `lower`, `islower`, `isupper`, `isalpha`, `isnumeric`, and `strip`. Do not mention functions like `split` because they require lists.

## Notes
- You can use [this visualization](/11102-s26/lesson-plans/images/slicing.png) when explaining string slicing.

- Don't waste time taking attendence this lecture. You are recording attendance anyway using the quiz papers!

- Students are very likely going to pull you at the beginning of the lecture to talk about the quiz. Becareful not to be dragged to spending a lot of time on that, as you have material to cover before the quiz!
