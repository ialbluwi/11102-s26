## Bits, Bytes, Kilobytes, etc.

A **bit** is the smallest unit of data in a computer. It can have a value of either 0 or 1. The term _bit_ is short for _binary digit._

Typically, bits are grouped together to form larger units of data. The most common grouping is the **byte**, which consists of 8 bits. Below is a breakdown of common data size units:

```
1 Bit           = A single binary digit (0 or 1)
1 Byte     (B)  = 8 bits
1 Kilobyte (KB) = 1,024 Bytes
1 Megabyte (MB) = 1,024 Kilobytes ≈ 1 Million  Bytes
1 Gigabyte (GB) = 1,024 Megabytes ≈ 1 Billion  Bytes
1 Terabyte (TB) = 1,024 Gigabytes ≈ 1 Trillion Bytes
```

---

### Possible Values with Bits

With **1** bit, we can represent **2** possible values: 0 and 1. 

With **2** bits, we can represent **4** possible values: 
```
00
01
10
11
```
With **3** bits, we can represent **8** possible values: 
```
000
001
010
011
100
101
110
111
```
As you can see, each additional bit doubles the number of possible values. Therefore, with $$n$$ bits, we can represent $$2^n$$ possible values. Hence, with 1 byte (8 bits), we can represent $$2^8 = 256$$ possible values, ranging from $$0$$ to $$255$$.

---

### How many bits are needed?

Let's consdier the following number of bits and their range of possible values:

```
# of Bits    Range of Possible Values
---------    ------------------------
    1          2^1 = 2 (0 to 1)
    2          2^2 = 4 (0 to 3)
    3          2^3 = 8 (0 to 7)
    4          2^4 = 16 (0 to 15)
    5          2^5 = 32 (0 to 31)
    6          2^6 = 64 (0 to 63)
    7          2^7 = 128 (0 to 127)
    8          2^8 = 256 (0 to 255)
```

Let's assume we want to store the number $$6$$ on a computer. How many bits do we need? Since $$6$$ in binary is `110`, we need at least **3 bits**. We can also use 4 bits: `0110`, 5 bits: `00110`, 6 bits: `000110`, or more, but the minimum is 3 bits.

---

How many bits are need to store the number **2025**? This is not clear from the table above.

Given a number of bits $$n$$, we can store numbers from $$0$$ to $$2^n - 1$$. Hence, we need to find the smallest $$n$$ such that:

$$2025 \leq 2^n - 1 \longrightarrow 2025 + 1 \leq 2^n$$

Taking the base-2 logarithm of both sides:

$$\log_2(2026) \leq n$$

Using a calculator, we find that $$\log_2(2026) \approx 10.98$$. Since $$n$$ must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number, so $$n = 11$$. This means we need at least **11 bits** to store the number 2025.

## Represnting Text

Since we can't directly store letters and characters on a computer, we store them as numbers. One common way to do this is using the **ASCII** (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) encoding system. In ASCII, each character is assigned a unique number between 0 and 127. For example:

<img src="/11102-s26/lessons/images/ascii.png" class="img-soft" style="display:block; margin: 20px auto;">

As you can see from the table above:
- `A` is represented by the number 65.
- `B` is represented by the number 66.
- `a` is represented by the number 97.
- `b` is represented by the number 98.
- `0` is represented by the number 48.
- `1` is represented by the number 49.
- The space character ` ` is represented by the number 32.

How many bits are needed to represent all ASCII characters? 
Since the highest ASCII value is 127, we can use our formula:

$$\textrm{bits} = \lceil \log_2(127 + 1) \rceil = \lceil \log_2(128) \rceil = \lceil 7 \rceil = 7$$

Thus, we need at least **7 bits** to represent all ASCII characters. However, in practice, we often use **1 byte (8 bits)** to store each ASCII character, leaving one bit unused.

### File Sizes

**Example 1:** Open a new empty file in VS Code and type: `ABCD`. Save the file as `abcd.txt`.

Now, check the size of the file. You should see that the file size is **4 bytes**. This is because each character (`A`, `B`, and `C`, `D`) is stored using 1 byte each.

---

**Example 2:** Modify the contents of the file to be: 
`أبجد`
Save the file again and check its size. You might be surprised to see that the file size is now **8 bytes**. 

Since ASCII only supports English letters and some special characters, the Arabic letters are stored using a different encoding system called **UTF-8**. In UTF-8, each Arabic character is represented using **2 bytes**. Therefore, the 4 Arabic letters `أ`, `ب`, `ج`, and `د` require a total of 8 bytes.

---

**Example 3:** Replace the Arabic letters with emojis, such as: `😀😃😄😁`. Save the file and check its size. You will find that the file size is now **16 bytes**. The reason is that emojis are represented using **4 bytes** each in UTF-8 encoding. Therefore, the 4 emojis require a total of 16 bytes.

### Fun with Python

Open a Python interactive shell (REPL) and type the following commands:

```python
ord('A')   # returns 65
ord('ب')   # returns 1576
ord('😀')  # returns 128512    
```

The `ord()` function in Python returns the corresponding numeric value of a character based on its encoding.

Now try the following:

```python
chr(65)      # returns 'A'
chr(1576)    # returns 'ب'
chr(128512)  # returns '😀'
```

The `chr()` function in Python returns the character corresponding to a given numeric value based on its encoding.

Putting it all together, what does the following function do?

```python
from random import randint

def mystery():
    r = randint(128511, 128591)
    print("Hello", chr(r))
```

## Representing Floating-Point Numbers

The actual representation of floating-point numbers in computers is quite complex and involves a standard called **IEEE 754**, which is beyond the scope of this course. Instead, we will discuss how to convert decimal (floating-point) numbers to binary. This will reveal some of the challenges involved in representing floating-point numbers.

---

### Representing the Fractional Part

We already know that a binary number like `1011` represents in decimal:

$$\begin{aligned}
1011_2 & = (1 \times 2^3) + (0 \times 2^2) + (1 \times 2^1) + (1 \times 2^0) \\
         & = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 \\
         & = 11
\end{aligned}$$

However, what does the binary number `0.1011` represent in decimal?

The idea is the same, but instead of powers of 2, we use powers of $$\frac{1}{2}$$ (or negative powers of 2):

$$
\begin{aligned}
0.1011_2 & = (1 \times 2^{-1}) + (0 \times 2^{-2}) + (1 \times 2^{-3}) + (1 \times 2^{-4}) \\
         & = \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \frac{1}{2}\ \ \ \ \ \ + \ \ \ \ \ \ 0\ \ \ \ \ \ \ + \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \frac{1}{8} \ \ \ \ \ + \ \ \ \ \ \ \frac{1}{16}\\
         & = \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0.5\ \ \ \ + \ \ \ \ \ \ 0\ \ \ \ \ \ \ +\ \ \ \ \ 0.125\ \ +\ \ \  0.0625 \\
         & = 0.6875
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, `0.1011` in binary is equal to `0.6875` in decimal.

Given a binary number with both integer and fractional parts, such as `110.101`, we can convert it to decimal by separating the two parts and converting each part individually.

### Converting a Decimal Fraction to Binary

To convert a decimal fraction to binary, we can use the following method:

1. Multiply the decimal fraction by 2.
2. The integer part of the result (0 or 1) becomes the next binary digit.
3. Take the fractional part of the result and repeat steps 1-3 until you reach the desired precision or the fractional part becomes 0.

**Example 1:** Convert `0.625` to binary.

```
0.625 * 2   = 1.25   -> Integer part: 1
0.25  * 2   = 0.5    -> Integer part: 0
0.5   * 2   = 1.0    -> Integer part: 1   
```

Reading the integer parts from top to bottom, we get `0.101` in binary. Thus, `0.625` in decimal is equal to `0.101` in binary.

**Example 2:** Convert `27.8125` to binary.

- Convert the integer part `27` to binary:
```
27 / 2 = 13 remainder 1
13 / 2 = 6  remainder 1
6  / 2 = 3  remainder 0
3  / 2 = 1  remainder 1
1  / 2 = 0  remainder 1
```
Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get `11011` in binary.

- Convert the fractional part `0.8125` to binary:
```
0.8125 * 2 = 1.625  -> Integer part: 1
0.625  * 2 = 1.25   -> Integer part: 1
0.25   * 2 = 0.5    -> Integer part: 0
0.5    * 2 = 1.0    -> Integer part: 1
```
Reading the integer parts from top to bottom, we get `0.1101` in binary.

Combining both parts, we get `27.8125` in decimal is equal to `11011.1101` in binary.

### Surprises with Floating-Point Numbers

Open a Python interactive shell (REPL) and type the following commands:

```python
print(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3)      # Expected output: True
print(0.1 + 0.2)             # Expected output: 0.3
```

You might be surprised to see that the first line outputs `False`, and the second line outputs `0.30000000000000004` instead of `0.3`.

This happens because some decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly in binary, leading to small rounding errors in floating-point arithmetic. This is a common issue in computer programming and numerical computing. 

Let's try converting `0.1` to binary using the method we discussed earlier:

```
0.1 * 2 = 0.2   -> Integer part: 0
0.2 * 2 = 0.4   -> Integer part: 0
0.4 * 2 = 0.8   -> Integer part: 0 <----
0.8 * 2 = 1.6   -> Integer part: 1
0.6 * 2 = 1.2   -> Integer part: 1
0.2 * 2 = 0.4   -> Integer part: 0 
0.4 * 2 = 0.8   -> Integer part: 0 (repeats)
0.8 * 2 = 1.6   -> Integer part: 1
0.6 * 2 = 1.2   -> Integer part: 1
0.2 * 2 = 0.4   -> Integer part: 0 
0.4 * 2 = 0.8   -> Integer part: 0 (repeats)
...
```

As you can see, the process will continue indefinitely, producing a repeating pattern. Therefore, `0.1` cannot be represented exactly in binary, leading to the small error we observed in Python.

### Floating-Point Comparison

When comparing floating-point numbers, it's often better to check if they are "close enough" rather than exactly equal. Otherwise, you might encounter unexpected results due to the representation issues we discussed.

Here is a common approach to compare floating-point numbers:

```python
from math import isclose

a = 0.1 + 0.2
b = 0.3

print(a == b)         # Output: False
print(isclose(a, b))  # Output: True
```

The `isclose()` function checks if two floating-point numbers are the same up to nine decimal places (by default), which helps avoid issues with tiny representation errors.
